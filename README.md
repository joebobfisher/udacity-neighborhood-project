# udacity-neighborhood-project

My Udacity Neighborhood final project, for the Udacity Front-End part of my
nanodegree.

This project includes a map of my neighborhood as well as some of my favorite
places.

# How to Use

Select any of the buttons off to the right, or any marker on the map, to get Foursquare data on that place. You can also use the _X Miles Away_ dropdown to only see the places that are _X_ miles away from my house, or nearer.

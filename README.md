# udacity-neighborhood-project

My Udacity Neighborhood final project, for the Udacity Front-End part of my
nanodegree.

This project includes a map of my neighborhood as well as some of my favorite
places.

# TODO

## Keep In Mind

* [Project Details Page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/135b6edc-f1cd-4cd9-b831-1908ede75737/modules/4fd8d440-9428-4de7-93c0-4dca17a36700/lessons/2711658591239847/concepts/26906985370923)
* Use KnockoutJS
* Interface must be intuitive!
* All APIs must be loaded asynchronously

## TODO List

* ~~Download KnockoutJS~~
    * ~~Create markers in ViewModel, _not_ as Knockout observables.~~
* ~~Add full-screen Google Maps map. Call map API only once.~~
* ~~Display map markers at >= 5 locations within neighborhood, by default when
page is loaded.~~
* ~~Add list view of those 5 locations.~~
* ~~Add filter input field to filter locations (in list view + map)~~
    * ~~List view & map markers should update in real time.~~
        * ~~So move the map to the selected marker, if selected in the list view!~~
    * ~~Can't use a 3rd part API for this search/filter.~~
    * ~~Filter can be text or dropdown menu~~
* Use non-Google Maps 3rd party APIs to give info when a map marker or list
view entry is clicked.
    * Implement as infoWindow (or in the sidebar/list view)
* Provide attribution to data sources/APIs used.
* Animate map marker when list item or marker itself is clicked.
* Handle errors gracefully
    * Handle "can't load" or "can't reach site" for all APIs called.

## Nice to Have

* Add ability to add new locations or favorite locations
* Incorporate build process that runs tests & minifies code
* Add data persistence
* Style markers differently
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Autocomplete in text filtering

# Attributions and Stuff I Used

* [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/)
* [Google Maps APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/)

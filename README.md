# udacity-neighborhood-project

My Udacity Neighborhood final project, for the Udacity Front-End part of my
nanodegree.

This project includes a map of my neighborhood as well as some of my favorite
places.

## How to Use

1. Clone the code from the GitHub repository to your machine.
1. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser. If your favorite browser is not available, use your second favorite.
1. Select any of the buttons off to the right, or any marker on the map, to get Foursquare data on that place.
1. You can also use the _X Miles Away_ dropdown to only see the places that are _X_ miles away from my house, or nearer.
